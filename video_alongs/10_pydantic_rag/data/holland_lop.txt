Holland Lop
The Holland Lop is a breed of lop-eared rabbit that
was recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders
Association (ARBA) in 1979. The Holland Lop, with a
maximum weight of 1.8 kg (4 lb) (as stipulated by
ARBA), is one of the smallest lop-eared breeds.[1]
Holland Lops are one of the most popular rabbit breeds
in the United States and the United Kingdom. They
were first bred by Dutch breeder Adrian de Cock, as a
hybrid of the French Lop and the Netherland
Dwarf.[2][3][4] Holland Lops are miniature rabbits that
only weigh about 1–2 kg (2–4 lb).[5] They are
muscular in relation to their compact frame, and have a
wide variety of coat colours. Their lopped ears are one
of their most distinctive features.[5][6]
The history of Holland Lops began with Dutch breeder
Adrian de Cock from Tilburg, Netherlands. Holland Lops
were acknowledged by the American Rabbit Breed
Association (ARBA) in 1979 and made known to the public
in 1980.[2][4]
When Adrian de Cock realized that French Lops were over-
sized and Netherland Dwarfs were under-sized in 1949, he decided to breed the two with each other in
hopes that their offspring will inherit the optimal size. French Lops weigh 4.5–6.8 kg (10–15 lb) while
Netherland Dwarfs only weigh around 0.5–1.1 kg (1.1–2.5 lb). Unfortunately, the results were nothing
like what de Cock expected. Their offspring were way too big and died as a result. The mother (female
Netherland Dwarf) also died from the breeding process. In 1951, de Cock decided to try the breeding
process again. Instead of using a Netherlands Dwarf doe, he used a male Netherland Dwarf buck. He did
not think that this was possible at first, because the French Lop was much bigger than the Netherland
Dwarf buck. The results exceeded de Cock's expectations. All of the offspring were normal-sized and had
standard ear positions. In 1952, de Cock wanted the rabbits' ears to be lopped (hanging limply), so he let
a French Lop's and a Netherland Dwarf buck's off-spring breed with the Sooty Fawn, an English Lop
with visibly lopped ears. The results were one with lopped ears, 2 with normal ears, and one with semi-

lopped ears. At the end of the breeding process in 1955, a Holland Lop weighing less than 3.0 kg (6.6 lb)
was born. 11 years after this significant event, de Cock announced Holland Lops weighing less than
2.0 kg (4.4 lb). Another goal at the time was to publicize Holland Lops. In 1964, these rabbits were
finally recognized by Dutch breeders and authorities, which led to the introduction of Holland Lops
across many countries in Europe.[2][4]
Sometime in 1965-1975, these rabbits made their first appearance in the United Kingdom thanks to
George Scott, an English rabbit breeder from Yorkshire county who found these Holland Lops. At this
time, the average weight of this breed was only about 1.5 kg (3.3 lb).[4][3] The history of the well-known
Mini Lop is also related to the history of the Holland Lop. When Scott found these Holland Lops, he
sought to make them even smaller, so he let the lightest Holland Lop off-springs breed with each other.
The result of this breeding process was the Mini Lop, which was acknowledged by the British Rabbit
Council in 1994.[3] In 1976, Holland Lops made their way to the United States, where they were
acknowledged by the American Rabbit Breeders Association 3 years later.[4][7] Over the years, Holland
Lops have traveled across the globe and their breeders' accepted maximum weight has changed
insignificantly with the actual weight of these rabbits.[2] Holland Lops are now one of the most well-
known rabbit breeds in the United States and the United Kingdom.[2][3]
Similar to most rabbits, Holland Lops' fur is very diverse with a wide variety of colors and combinations.
The different colors include Chocolate, Lilac, Blue, Black, Chestnut, and Frosty. Some examples of fur
patterns include broken color (a pattern of patches of color on a white base fur), tortoise, solid, and tri-
colored. Almost any normal color can come in a broken variant. When they are shown, it is in broken and
solid groups according to the ARBA standard of perfection.[8] Albino Holland Lops with white fur and
red eyes are not unheard of. A mutation, very rare among Holland Lops, produces a dark orange color
known as ASIP or Agouti Signaling Protein. This color is distinct from the normal light orange color.[9]
The ears are one of Holland Lops' most distinct features, inheriting their lopped ears from the French Lop
and Sooty Fawns. These almond-shaped ears are about 12 cm (4.7 in).
Their eye color is usually black, but can be brown, blue or other colors.[7]
Holland Lops' tails are fluffy and small.[5]
The feet of the Holland Lop can be categorized into 6 types: ideal, narrow hindquarters, pinched
hindquarters, thin bone, thin long bone, and pinched. Since Holland Lops are very small, their legs are
also short and stubby. They also have claws that are not used very often.

Ideal Holland Lop feet are parallel and symmetrical. This foot
type indicates that the rabbit will have heavy compact bone,
and mass. Narrow hindquarters feet are closer, but still
parallel. This indicates less width towards the back, but they
still maintain a heavy bone and compact type. Pinched
hindquarters heels point towards each other, causing the feet
to create a V-shape. This may cause the feet to appear at the
bottom when posing for a show. Thin boned feet are shorter
and thinner than other structures. This indicates that the rabbit
will have medium bone and will remain compact, however
will have less mass. Thin, long boned foot structure can cause
a change throughout other areas of the rabbit's body, making
the head pointier, and the ears longer and thinner. In addition,
the feet are longer than thin boned feet, and increase the
overall size of the rabbit. Pinched and narrow hindquarters is
a combination of the pinched hindquarters and narrow
hindquarters foot structures. The heels point towards each
other and are closer together, which leads to the hindquarters to appear more hollow.
According to the Holland Lop show standards, they are expected to be muscular for their short size.
"Broad shoulders and deep hindquarters" are expected traits from a high quality Holland Lop, according
to a judge from the Holland Lop Specialty Club. They also added that the legs should be "thick, short, and
heavily boned." In shows, the body is worth a total of 32 points.[10]
The Holland Lop's flesh is known to be muscular and well-toned. This is especially true when applied to
high ranking show Holland Lops.[7] They have "short, rounded noses," which differentiates them from
other lop breeds, such as the mini lop.[11] Holland Lops usually weigh 1–2 kg (2–4 lb). However,
according to ARBA show standards, the Holland Lop at maximum weight is 1.8 kg (4 lb).
Holland Lops as a breed are considered to be very calm
rabbits even though they tend to come off as shy at first. As a
result of this, owners can expect to spend time playing and
relaxing with their Lops. In addition to exercise, Holland
Lops also require toys to chew on. This is not only important
for keeping them occupied, but also for avoiding destructive
behaviour to other objects or property.[12]
As a whole, the Holland Lop is considered to be a very
friendly breed. Male rabbits (bucks) have been reported to be
less nippy than female rabbits (does), although they do tend to
experience a stage where they are shyer and nippy. This

typically occurs when they would like to be bred. However, does are often much neater than bucks.
Bucks have been known to exhibit destructive behavior, often resulting in ruined cages.
A study in the UK found that lop eared rabbits – such as the Holland Lop – had worse dental health than
other breed types. The study found lop-eared rabbits to have a 23 times greater risk of incisor pathology
(underbite, overbite, overgrown or fractured incisors), a 12 times greater risk of molar overgrowth, a 13
times greater risk of molar sharpness, and a significant greater risk of molar spurs compared to erect-
eared rabbits.[13]
